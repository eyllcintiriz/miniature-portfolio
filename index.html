            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Hi there, my name is Eylül and I'm a freshman at TOBB ETÜ.
                My education journey started at Arı Schools in Ankara. From primary 
                school to high school , I tried to participate in lots of different projects 
                there. In primary school I was in the creative science basis community and we were 
                trying to create so many usefull gadgets with so little instruction and equipment
                I was in art and also theatre comunity for three years and we had lots of plays. 
                I sang at some of our schools concerts and i was also in the 
                school chore for three years. I also maintained my English and Spanish while
                being an active, hardworking student. After those 12 years of lots of experience and fun,
                I decided to study computer science as my university degree since I adored 
                computer and technology related topics and also coding and solving problems.
                After I attended the university exam of Turkey's educational system, my university life 
                at TOBB ETÜ started. Now it is my third semester there and I am a board member in our university's
                Computer Science Community. In addition, I am the vice-chairman of App Development Community.
